# collect_set

## Reason

We use collect_set in quite a few Directories and Search processes. The one that brought me to this question is in
the [Initial Extract](https://github.optum.com/polaris-provider-search-and-directories/new-dir-initial-extract) 
Service Area processing inside of get_mdm_xmls.
