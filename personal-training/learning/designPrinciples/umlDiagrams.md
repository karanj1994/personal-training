## Notes

- UML = Unified Modeling Language
- UML Diagrams are used to explain the **behavior and structure** of a system
  - **Behavior Diagram** - Captures dynamic aspects of a system
  - **Structural Diagram** - Static aspects of a system
- Behavioral and Structural diagrams can be further subcategorized:
  - Structural:
    - **Class Diagram** - Depicts the static structure of system's classes,
    methods, and attributes and how they interact with each other
    - **Composite Structure Diagram** - Represents the internal structure of a class and its interaction points
    with other parts of a system.
