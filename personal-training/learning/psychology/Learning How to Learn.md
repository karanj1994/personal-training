- Working Memory is like an inefficient chalkboard that can hold 4-7 things at once
- Long-term memory is like a warehouse that can be "tapped into"
- Long-term memories can be more easily accessed with consistent acquisition into working memory
- It's harder to grasp abstract concepts like math because there aren't specific examples of them just existing; they're purely applied concepts
- Diffuse learning is associated with "creative" learning and can be tapped into by taking siestas and being suddenly awoken if you're thinking about a troubling topic
- Focused learning is with pattern application and can be improved with the "Pomodoro" method where you focus for 25 minutes and then reward yourself for focusing
- For better memory retention, it's better to spread learning a topic over a period of time as opposed to cramming
- Clustering is the idea of lumping together common "topics" into one memory space (which can be layered)
- Epistemology is the study of knowledge
- Metaphysics is the study of being/existing

## Advice from the MOOC Creator

- Learn by DOING instead of reading
- Be engaged during meetings by asking questions
- Diffuse learning -> sleeping and exercise without distractions (and bring a notebook!)
- Multitasking is a necessity for being successful (moreso context switching)
  - Personal Note: Before context switching, write down the last step of the thing you were working on
- Be in a stimulating environment, stay engaged in discussions and learning, and your hippocampal neurons will grow
